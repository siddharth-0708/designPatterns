localStorage is a web storage mechanism that allows websites to store key-value data persistently in the browser, even after the browser is closed or the computer is restarted. It is domain-specific, meaning data stored under one origin (protocol + domain + port) cannot be accessed by another origin, and subdomains are treated separately. localStorage is commonly used for storing user preferences (like theme or language), caching frequently accessed data to reduce server calls, maintaining application state (such as progress in multi-step forms), storing tokens or temporary credentials (though HttpOnly cookies are safer for sensitive auth data), and basic analytics like visit counts. Unlike cookies, data in localStorage is not automatically sent to the server with each request, making it more efficient for client-side storage, but it is vulnerable to XSS attacks if the site is not secure.
