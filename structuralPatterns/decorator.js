/*Decorator: Facilitates the addition of behaviours to individual objects without inheriting from them.
Decorator Pattern uses composition specifically to add new functionality at runtime.
ðŸ‘‰ It wraps the original object inside another object.
ðŸ‘‰ It doesnâ€™t change the original class â€” just adds new behavior "from the outside."
