/*
A pattern in which the object's behavior is determinded by its state. A object transitions from one state to another (something needs to trigger a transition).

A formalized construct which manages state and transitions is called a state machine.

/* STATE DESIGN PATTERN:

The State Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object changed its class.

Instead of using multiple if/else or switch statements to handle behavior based on the current state, the object delegates behavior to different state objects.

Each state object encapsulates the behavior associated with a particular state.

ðŸ§  Core Concept:
Think of it like a finite state machine. An object can be in one state at a time, and based on events, it transitions to other states, changing its behavior accordingly.
