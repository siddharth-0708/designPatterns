/*
Liskov Substitution Principle: 
Defination 1: If you have a function that works with a parent class, it should also work with its child classes without breaking or behaving unexpectedly.

Defination 2: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.

Defination 3: If class B is a subclass of class A, then you should be able to replace A with B anywhere in the code, without breaking the program's expected behavior.
